# FFfmp4
FFfmp4 is a suite of Windows batch files for encoding media to fragmented mp4 format, "fmp4", and packaging it for MPEG DASH and HLS streaming. Hopefully in the future Apple will support MPEG DASH and it will not no longer be necessary to include HLS.

To use FFfmp4 download the directory and open fffmp4.bat which will check for dependencies and initiate the pipeline. This project was developed for personal use but you are welcome to use any of it as you see fit.
