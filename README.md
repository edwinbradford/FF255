# FF255
FF255 is a collection of bash scripts for re-encoding media. It will check to see if FFmpeg is installed and warn you if it isn't. The scripts should work on all platforms and have been tested on macOS and Windows. Windows users need bash to run the scripts, the easiest way to run bash on Windows is to install Git for Windows which includes Git Bash.

The scripts include:

FMP4
CRF20MP4
CFR60MP4
DNxHD90

FMP4 encodes media as fragmented MP4 (FMP4) and packages it for adaptive bitrate streaming via HTTP as MPEG-DASH and HLS streams. Currently the streams generated by FMP4 validate but do not stream with consistent results in MPEG-DASH and HLS players. I'm unable to find any errors and put the inconsistent results down to the immaturity of the FMP4, MPEG-DASH and HLS formats and lack of mature media players.

CRF20MP4 encodes video as H264 MP4 using a Constant Rate Factor (CRF) of 20 which generates high quality video. The settings used in this script are suitable for online videos that will be self hosted and don't need adaptive bitrate streaming over HTTP. Four resolutions are supported 1080p, 720p, 480p and 360p.

CFR60MP4 is desigend to re-encode source video at a constant frame rate (CFR) of 60 frames per second. At the time of writing, variable frame rate (VFR) MP4s commonly generated by phones and portable cameras have missing green frames when edited in video editing software. Converting the video to a constant frame rate fixes the issue.
